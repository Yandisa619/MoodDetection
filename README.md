Mood Detection Chatbot
Overview
The Mood Detection Chatbot is a conversational AI built to detect the mood or emotional state of a user based on their input. By using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the chatbot analyzes text inputs to determine if the user is happy, sad, angry, or neutral. This project aims to help provide emotional support or appropriate responses based on the user's mood.

Features
Mood Detection: Detects the mood of the user (happy, sad, angry, or neutral) based on their messages.
Conversational Flow: Provides empathetic or suitable responses based on the detected mood.
Customizable Responses: Easily customize chatbot responses for different moods.
Machine Learning Integration: Uses a machine learning model for emotion classification from text.
User-friendly Interface: Simple text-based interface to interact with the chatbot.
Technologies Used
Python: The core language for chatbot development.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Libraries like NLTK, spaCy for text processing.
Machine Learning: Libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for mood classification model.
Flask/Django (optional): For deploying the chatbot as a web application.
OpenAI API (optional): For more advanced conversational abilities (if integrated).
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)
Steps to Install
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mood-detection-chatbot.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd mood-detection-chatbot
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On MacOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model (if applicable):

If you are using a custom mood detection model, make sure to train it using the dataset before using the chatbot.
Run the chatbot:

bash
Copy code
python chatbot.py
Alternatively, if it's deployed as a web application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the chatbot:

If it's a command-line interface (CLI) chatbot, you can start chatting directly in the terminal.
If it's a web app, open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
Usage
Start the chatbot and type a message. The chatbot will analyze your text input and respond based on your detected mood.
Mood Categories: The chatbot is trained to recognize moods such as:
Happy
Sad
Angry
Neutral
The chatbot will adjust its responses accordingly to help the user feel more understood or provide appropriate feedback.
